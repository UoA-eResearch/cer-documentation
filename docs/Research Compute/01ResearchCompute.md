# Overview

The {{ institution_name }}, provides a number of services to support researchers with their computational needs.

These are introduced in the following pages.

To provide rough guidance: 

- If you need to process a large amount of data, or run a complex simulation, you will need to use a High Performance Computing (HPC) system. Some also call this a Supercomputer.
- If you need a virtual machine (VM)...
    - you can either use the {{ institution_name }}  [Research VM Farm](/docs/Research%20Compute/UoAResearchVM%20Farm.md)
    - or if you need a GPU, have less sensitive data, want more liberty, you can use the [Nectar Research Cloud](/docs/Research%20Compute/Nectar.md)
