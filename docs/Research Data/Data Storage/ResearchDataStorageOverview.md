# Research Data Overview

At {{ institution name }}, we have access to several services that allow us to store research data. This section provides an overview of the research data that is used in the research project and relevant stages. These are introduced in this category.

Initial guidance in selecting the most appropriate option on the Research Hub's ["Choosing data storage"](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/guide-to-managing-research-data/research-data-management-or-storage-compute-and-analysis/choosing-data-storage).

The two main options are:

- [Dropbox for Researchers](/docs/Research%20Data/Data%20Storage/Dropbox.md)
- [Research Drive](/docs/Research%20Data/Data%20Storage/Research%20Drive/research-drive.md)
