# Research Drive
some intro

## Existing copy-paste template

- That researchers receive as a ticket-response.
- How to mount the Drive on
  - Mac
  - Win
  - Linux
- VPN
- Generic (i.e. with clear placeholders where and what has to be inserted)
- Idea is that one PI onboarding new students can share this and doesn't have to either get in touch with us or find the old ticket
