# Globus

Globus is a tool designed to facilitate file transfers. After some initial setup, you won't be required to log-in to a multitude of services, transfers happen fast and if the connection is interrupted, they are automatically resumed (within certain limits). 

There are two versions of Globus:

- the server-version: *Globus* that is also called the *Data Transfer Node (DTN)*, *Globus Server* or *Globus Endpoint*
- a client-version that you can install on your physical computer (or VM) called *Globus Connect Personal*

Usually, one side (or endpoint) has to be a server; in other words: Transfer GCP to GCP do not work. There are exceptions, please get in touch.

Globus is a web-based tool that allows you to upload and download data. It is also possible to use the command line to transfer data, but this is more complicated.
