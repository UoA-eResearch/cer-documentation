# Batch Video Compression

Pro:

- in many cases: same video/audio quality perceived by a human at a fraction of file size required
- smaller file size
- easier to handle
- less power consumption
- backup in itself
- no changes to existing folder sturcture (your videos stay in the same place as they are, just with a different file extension)

Con:

- needs manual labor (but can be automated)
- doesn't work for certain files (rare; talk to us if in doubt)
- computational intensive process (but we supply the hardware; Virtual Machines (VMs))
- can be corrupted (but we have a backup)
