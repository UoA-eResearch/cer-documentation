# Figshare
Figshare is intended to publish files or artifacts that are not expected to change over time. This is in contrast to the UoA's Research Data Store (RDS) which is intended for active research data.
Publications on Figshare get a digital object identifier (DOI) assigned whose version will be increased if a change is executed. Example of a Figshare publication:  `https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.16599404.v1` versus `https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.16599404.v2`.

A common mistake is not to be aware of the difference between

- (figshare.com)[https://figshare.com/] is the commercial service
- (auckland.figshare.com)[https://figshare.auckland.com/] is our/the UoA instance of figshare.com

## Common issues

- file size limitations (2GB per file)
- uploading many files is challenging
- videos should be optimised (downscaled, efficient codec)
