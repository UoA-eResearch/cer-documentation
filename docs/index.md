# Start here

This is just a **temporary landing page**.

A longer post including some **theory** of documentation and **showcasing the abilities** of this documentation (i.e., MKDocs Material) can be found [here](projects/DocumentationArchitecture/index.md)

The category '**Codelab**' has a special purpose. It showcases the ability to create a multi-step tutorial and incorporates several neat features to improve the User Experience (in summary: Instead of a *wall of text* the content is broken down into small steps, each step is a separate page, and the user can navigate through the steps using the navigation).

The category '**Projects**' mainly contains the ingested *CeR Services Handbook* (previously called **VM Handbook**) which is intended to be replaced and currently is hosted [here](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/vmhandbook/)

**MyTardis** or the Instrument Data Service (IDS) is shown in the respective sub-category of Research Data. It currently contains:

- [The Ingestion Wizard](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/cer-documentation/Research%20Data/Data%20Storage/IDS/Wizard/01-what-is-wizard/)
- and current implementation of a [code reference](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/cer-documentation/Research%20Data/Data%20Storage/IDS/reference/beneficiations/) (i.e. not intended for the general end-user but for people working on the codebase) but a GoogleDocstring-based reference.


## Decisions to be made: 

We will have to agree on the following:

- do we want to use this solution?
- what are the top-level categories
- what are the sub-categories
- what content is
  - existing (up to date, vs. needs update)
  - needs to be added
  - should be pointed at
