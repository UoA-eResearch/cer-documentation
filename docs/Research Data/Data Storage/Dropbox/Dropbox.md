# Background
At {{ institution_name}}, we can provide an institutional license to **Dropbox**** which is a commercial cloud storage service.
Detailed information (including how to access it) can be found on the [Research Hub](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/guide-to-managing-research-data/research-data-management-or-storage-compute-and-analysis/dropbox-for-researchers). 

Currently, this means that you get unlimited storage space for your research data.

!!! bug
        make sure that the latest update if there is an ATO by CISO to use Dropbox for sensitive data

You invite external collaborators by sharing a sub-folder (this is an important distinction with more guidance provided here), which enables these to also upload a theoretically unlimited amount of data.
You are responsible for keeping track and potentially revoking access to these folders.
