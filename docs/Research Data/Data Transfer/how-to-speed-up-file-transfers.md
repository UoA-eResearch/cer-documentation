While Globus is designed with a focus on fast data transfers, there are some things you can do to speed up your transfers.

- use a wired (ethernet-cable) connection, ideally come to Campus, make sure that WiFi is disabled, especially on a Mac both can run simultaneously
- try not to use the VPN if possible 
- for extreme use-cases, you might be able to make use of the CeR 10GBit connection
