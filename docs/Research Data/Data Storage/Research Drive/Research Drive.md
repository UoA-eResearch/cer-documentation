# Research Drive

Research Drives are Network drives that are managed by the UoA and within our firewall.
A detailed comparison can be found [here](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/guide-to-managing-research-data/research-data-management-or-storage-compute-and-analysis/choosing-data-storage). 

To highlight some important aspects, Research Drives are the preferred option if your data...

- ... is sensitive and your Ethics Approval requires you to store it on a UoA managed system (and/or) within New Zealand
- ... shall be easily accessible from a Virtual Machine (LINK) or a HPC (LINK)

## How to get access to a Research Drive

While the process of making the Research Drive available on your computer is similar, special attention has to be paid to the syntax/the exact use of the address. This differs per operating system.

Another factor is where you try to access the research drive from.
