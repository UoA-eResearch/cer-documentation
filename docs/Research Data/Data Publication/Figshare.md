# Figshare
Figshare is a data publishing platform intended to publish files or artifacts that are **not** expected to **change** over time. At {{ institution_name }} we have access to an institutional instance of Figshare. More details to be found [here](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/guide-to-managing-research-data/publishing-data/institutional-figshare).

While a thesis and other research publications are managed by the [Library](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/article/depositing-theses), Figshare is intended for **other research data** such as videos, images, or datasets. These are often referenced in a publication via a [Data Availability Statement](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/guide-to-managing-research-data/publishing-data/data-availability-statements). 

Publications on Figshare get a digital object identifier (DOI) assigned whose version-number will be increased if a change is executed. See this example `https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.16599404.v1` versus `https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.16599404.v2`.

## Common issues
A common mistake is not to be aware of the difference between

- `https://figshare.com/` is the commercial service
- `[https://figshare.auckland.com/` *our*/the {{ institution_name }} instance of `figshare.com`

Moreover, 

- file size limitations (2GB per file)
- uploading many files is challenging
- videos should be optimised (downscaled, efficient codec)


## Good examples (videos)

## Figshare branded Group sites
Figshare allows to create branded group sites. This is a good option for research groups that want to publish their data on Figshare.
Examples are to be found [here](https://auckland.figshare.com/groups).
